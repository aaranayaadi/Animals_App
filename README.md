This is a very basic android application using fundamental concepts of android development such as recycle view, on click listener, etc., while utilising java and XML
This app shows a list of a few animals. When clicked on, these animals show details along with their image
I have created this application as a sophomore working on android app development for the first time. Hopefully I'll be able to make apps that are more advance here onwards

I've crafted a basic Android application, employing fundamental concepts of Android development such as RecyclerView, OnClickListener, and more, using Java and XML. This project revolves around showcasing a list of select animals. Upon selection, each animal provides detailed information accompanied by an image. As a sophomore, this endeavor marks my inaugural foray into Android app development, reflecting my commitment to acquiring and applying foundational skills in this domain. Through this project, I've gained valuable hands-on experience, honing my abilities to navigate the intricacies of mobile app development and laying the groundwork for future, more sophisticated undertakings in the Android development landscape.
